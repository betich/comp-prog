A student must not sit next the other students that take the same subject. Your program will get the numbers of students taking the exam for group1 and group2, total rows and seats per row.  Then checking that all inputs are valid according to the given conditions. Column and row of the room starts from 1. \n","\n","For the seating, students from group1 will be seated on odd column, and students from group2 will be seated on even column. The ID sequence of each subject is based on the seating policy.  \n","\n","By default, seating will be assigned **`by_row`**, students from group1 and group2 are alternately seated from left to right until the row is full. Then, repeat for the remaining rows and students.\n","\n","If the seating policy is **`by_column`**, students from each group will be seated sequentially in each column. The the column is full, next student will be assigned to the first row of next group's column.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","```\n","Example of empty exam room seating map with 4 rows and 6 seats per row\n","\n","      -------------------------\n","      |       Exam Room       |\n","      -------------------------\n","row 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n","      -------------------------\n","row 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n","      -------------------------\n","row 3 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n","      -------------------------\n","row 4 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n","      -------------------------\n","        1   2   3   4   5   6\n","                column\n","```\n","\n","Example \n","\n","* group 1 has 10 students\n","* group 2 has 5 students\n","* number of rows is 4\n","* seats per row is 6\n","\n","**** seat ID will always have length 3.
