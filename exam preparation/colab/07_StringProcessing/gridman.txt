Time to open your eyes
And see the way that world as we know it
Has come under attack yet once again!

Living in a place in time where it all seems so fake
Finally our S.O.S starts to pick up its pace
Even though we know that something just feels kind of off
I look up at the sky, the one I recognize
And wonder what it was we promised

What was it, the oath we made back on that day?
Don’t remember what we talked of in the classroom again
At this rate the vow we made will crumble as it starts to fade away

Time to open your eyes
And see the way that world as we know it
Has come under attack yet once again!
No, this is not a drill, or a final run before it begins
Unveil the daily life that’s been hid for so long
Tear it off with all the force you can expend
Hear the ring of the bell and jump in
Team up, and fight together, ‘cause with your help I know we can win
Your life was dull up until now
I’m here to get you out
